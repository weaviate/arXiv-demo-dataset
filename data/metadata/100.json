We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h.

In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed.

Models with\nV_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x\n10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our\nresults are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of\n$4500\\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of\nAngus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter\n$M_{HDM} \\le 0.6\\times 10^{15}\\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\\le\n1\\times 10^{15}\\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 18:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23","authors_parsed":[["Zhao","HongSheng","","SUPA, St Andrews"]]}

This is done via a study of the\ngeometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show\nthat any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie\ngroup S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an\nasymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a\nlimiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss\nthe speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to\nergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant\nmetrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series\nof nilpotent groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2007 16:59:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 05:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-11","authors_parsed":[["Breuillard","Emmanuel",""]]}
